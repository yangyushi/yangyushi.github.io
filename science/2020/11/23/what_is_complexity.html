<hr />

<p>This is the note that I took during an interesting talk given by Karoline Wiesner in a colloquium in the physics department of the university of Bristol.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="truisms-of-complexity">Truisms of Complexity</h2>

<p>What Wiesner did here is writing down all the “very very true” statements about complexity.</p>

<ol>
  <li>More is diffirent → Emergence, something new that we saw not on the individuals but only when bringing individuals together</li>
  <li>Nonliving systems can generate order</li>
  <li>Complexity can comr from simplicity</li>
  <li>Coordinated behaviours does not require an overall controller</li>
  <li>Complex systems are often modelled as networks or information processing systems</li>
  <li>There are various kinds of invariance and forms of universal behaviour in complex systems → typically, we see power law distributions</li>
  <li>Complexity science is computational and probabilistic</li>
  <li>Complexity science involves multiple disciplines</li>
  <li>There is a difference between the order that system produce and the order of the inherent system</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="features-of-complexity">Features of Complexity</h2>

<ol>
  <li>spontaneous order and self-organisation</li>
  <li>Nonlinearity → especially as a response to external signal</li>
  <li>Robustness → otherwise we can’t observe the system since it will vanish</li>
  <li>Nested structure</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conditions-for-complexity">Conditions for Complexity</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Numerosity → many interactions</li>
  <li>Disorder and diversity</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>
  <li>Non-equilibrium → literially means not in thermodynamic equilibrium</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="complexity-in-functional-systems">Complexity in Functional Systems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>modularity: different parts integrate different functions</li>
  <li>History and Memory: system need to store informatino</li>
  <li>Adaptive Behaviour: system <em>modify</em> its behaviour</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="classical-measuring-complexity">Classical Measuring Complexity</h2>

<p>Classical (80s and 90s) measures are all designed for “strings”</p>

<ul>
  <li>statistical complexity (Crutchfield, Young Grassberger, 1986)</li>
  <li>Effective complexity (Gell-Mann, Lloyd, 1996)</li>
  <li>Thermodynamic depth (Lloyd, Pagels, 1988)</li>
  <li>Logical depth (Bennett, 1991) → How long would a computer take to generate the correlation in a string</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measuring-complexity">Measuring Complexity</h2>

<p>A newer approach, measuring different features of the complexity, there are some examples</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disorder: Shannon Entropy (-PlogP)</li>
  <li>Feedback: Lotka-Volterra equations</li>
  <li>Nonlinearity: $P(x)=cx^{-\gamma}$, looking for power law distribution</li>
  <li>Order: Correlations, Mutual information (Dunleavey, 2015, Nature Comm)</li>
  <li>Robustness: ACF function, fast relax → robust</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t compare complexity amongest different systems because the concept of complexity is multi dimensional.</p>

<h2 id="my-thought">My thought</h2>

<p>It is a nice talk and good summary of science from different fields. I am a collective behaviour person and I am happy that examples of bees and ants were mentioned. I was expecting something more <em>revolutionary</em> and overwhelming from this talk but it did not ended up that way. IMHO, the concept of complexity is re-interpeted as a collection of multiple concepts, measured as the disorder, feedback, nonlinearity etc. This interoperation might be <em>true</em> (as they were deduced from <em>truisms</em>) but the complexity of the universe shuold be more <em>universal</em> in my naïve fantasy. Anyway, I will have to read more related work to give a fair comment.</p>
