<p>I enjoyed the little online tests like everybody do, because I always learn something about myself from the result. IMO this is a good thing proveded for us by the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="human-benchmark">Human Benchmark</h2>

<p>I discoverd the <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com">human benchmark website</a> today and had a lot of fun with it. Basically, there are several test on the website that reflects the mental or physical abilities of someone. Something simple like memorising numbers or typing letters.</p>

<p>I learned superising facts about myself from my results! It looks like I got pretty good memory with numbers, but my reaction time to visual stimulus is very bad. My typical result is in the following figure.</p>

<p>I am quite sad knwoing I got shitty reaction time, because I was hoping to be good with the game Street Fighter III.</p>

<h2 id="political-compass">Political Compass</h2>

<p>I took the tests on the <a href="https://politicalcompass.org">political compass website</a> every now and then just for fun. The result fluctuates as I age gradually. My latest result is something like below.</p>

<pre class="asciiart">

<p>I guess this means I am a proper socialist. It is not so suprising given my communist Chinese background. But I am also a bit different as China is a politically authoritarian country with left economy policies.</p>

<p>I never read any book from my corresponding <a href="https://politicalcompass.org/libLeftBooks">reading list</a>. Maybe I should start now?</p>
