<p>I am using extra spaces inside my Chinese sentences to make it more obvious for myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>One quite obvious difference between Chinese and English sentences is <strong>the space</strong>.
I was not appreciate this “word separator” in an English sentence, until I was playing with some natural language processing ideas.
With the space in between, it is so easy to tear apart a sentence into individual words.</p>

<p>For instance, let us look at this famous sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In python, one use something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">words = sentence.split(" ")</code> to get a <code class="highlighter-rouge">list</code> of words. Simple and quick.</p>

<p>The nice thing about such easy separation is that, even in the absence of any knowledge about the English language, one can start looking at the frequence distribution of the words, and have a lot fun.</p>

<p>However, the Chinese equivalent is the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这只快速的灰狐狸跳过了这只懒狗</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no easy way to separate individual words without knowing Chinese very well.
Which means, separating Chinese words is quite challenging for a computer.
One typically needs a machine learning algorithm to get following results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>这只 快速的 灰 狐狸 跳 过了 这只 懒 狗</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite luckily, most skilled Chinese users can perform such separation with their brains quickly.
So the lack of space is not a problem in my daily life.</p>

<p>But when I am learning a “very scientific” field, like statistical mechanics, things began getting out of control very quickly.
The following sentence is an example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>热力学第二定律变分形式的有益使用不仅为热平衡建立了判据，而且将积分因子 T 与我们实际上设想为温度的性质等同起来</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My brain simply refuse to process this information. Spliting these words is quite difficult for me.
Because I am not familar with the jargon in statistical mechanics.</p>

<p>The equivalent English version is a bit more accessable even for me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An instructive use of the variational form of
the second law establishes the criterion for
thermal equilibrium and identifies the integrating
factor, T, as the property we really conceive of
as the temperature</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I discovered that adding a few space in the Chinese sentences makes it a lot more readable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>热力学第二定律 变分形式的有益使用 不仅为 热平衡 建立了判据，而且将 积分因子 T 与 我们实际上设想为温度的性质 等同起来</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sentence gets better visually if I use the very elegend Chinese bracket symbol 「」to emphasise the most important part in the sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>热力学第二定律 变分形式的有益使用 不仅为 热平衡 建立了判据，而且将 积分因子 T 与「我们实际上设想为温度的性质」等同起来</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the above sentence, I immediate realise this is about the statistical definition of temperature.</p>

<p>Generally I am now writing Chinese sentences with a few spaces. It helped me quite well when I am learning something new.</p>
